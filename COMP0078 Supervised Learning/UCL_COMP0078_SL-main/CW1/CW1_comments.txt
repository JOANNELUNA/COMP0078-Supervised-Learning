Q1: 5/5, Q2: 10/10, Q3: 5/5, Q4: 10/10, Q5: 20/20, Q6: 5/5, In the future, you should consider a different colour scheme as the white points are difficult to see. Q7: 7/7 Q8: 7/8 I think you've understood why opt k increases with m, but it would be improved if you could include more detail, in particular why there is a need for larger k as the training set grows (-1pt) Q9: 4/10, a) -1 pt: proof that K_c is not a kernel for c < 0 is missing b) -5 pts: correct answer is that c>0 adds a bias (value of c does not influence the solution) and c=0 recovers the usual linear regression solution Q10: 15/15, Q11: 4/5, -1 pt: the fact that we need to work modulo 2 is missing, note that the determinant is not necessarily non-zero, it is possible that no solution exists (no point deducted)Total: 92/100
